Git Commands

Initialize a git repository in a directory:
git init

Normal Route to Update Master Branch:
git add file.name (or just a . to add everything in project)
git commit -m "Messge to send to GitHub when you push"
git push origin master

To pull OVERRIDE and REPLACE everything with the master branch:
!!!This will override any changes you have made and update with where the master branch is!!!
git reset --hard origin/master

Store the changes in a dirty working directory. Reverts the working directory to match the HEAD commit.
git stash
git stash list
