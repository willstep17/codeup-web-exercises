        <h3>Yellowstone</h3>
        <dd class="invisible">Even if Yellowstone didn't hold the incredible distinction of
            being the world's first national park, the 2.2 million-acre park could easily stand on
            its own for its unique natural attractions and diverse geography. Here, travelers can get
            lost in the splendor of Yellowstone's many lakes, mountains, buffalo-filled valleys and, of course,
            its unmatched geysers and hot springs. To avoid the crowds that often plague the park, plan to visit
            in April, May, September or October.</dd>
